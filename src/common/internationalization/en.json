    "description": "My first contact with programming was in 2015, when I created a Minecraft server that quickly became popular, reaching 90 simultaneous players. However, the technology field was not as widespread, especially for a young person from a small town. After finishing high school in 2017, I went through several courses searching for something that truly connected with me, and in 2019, I found the opportunity to bring my ideas to life and create innovative solutions in the technology field. My goal is to continue learning and growing as a Frontend developer, contributing to the creation of digital products that make a difference."
